# practicalMachineLearning

This is a repo for the course project for the Coursera Practical Machine Learning course.

My R markdown file is the "machineLearningProject.md" file, and the compiled HTML version is labelled "machineLearningProject.html".

I have had several problems creating the gh-pages branch, so the compiled HTML file may need to be downloaded for viewing. But it is possible that the following link will work: kghatala.github.io/machineLearningProject.
